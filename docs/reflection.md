This lab showed me that github is more than a file upload but a simplistic way to track and plan work. The issues tab forced me to break it down, so it felt more like a task than just a free-for-all of code changes. Branches and pull requests also showed how this doesn't have to be one long timeline of a mess on main but can be separated, enhanced, and merged in a clean way with a visible record of the changes made. The most enjoyable part was watching the history unfold in the commits and the pull requests because it feels documented and official. The hardest part was ensuring that each branch had multiple commits and that the work was not done in the "wrong" commit or the "wrong" branch. If I had more time, I would make the 'talabat-clone' idea feasible by possibly creating a simple food list page with a basic add-food input and a daily total so that it's a tracker and not just an idea.
